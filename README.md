# Moneyview-Services
In this dashboards i tracked all high level services and their success in moneyview
• By tracking vendor success rates and flagging failures (e.g., Karza IMPS at 0%), this dashboard creates accountability and early warning for service-driven funnel loss.
• I learned that service uptime is a business lever — when KYC/IMPS fail, disbursals, time, and money drop immediately.
• Next step is to estimate business loss per failure so leaders see impact without manual deep-dive.
